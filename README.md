You are given two strings - pattern and source. The first string pattern contains only the symbols 0 and 1, and the second string source contains only lowercase English letters.
Let's say that pattern matches a substring source[l..r] of source if the following three conditions are met:
they have equal length,
for each 0 in pattern the corresponding letter in the substring is a vowel,
for each 1 in pattern the corresponding letter is a consonant.
Your task is to calculate the number of substrings of source that match pattern.
Note: In this task we define the vowels as 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', and 'y'. All other letters are consonants.*/
